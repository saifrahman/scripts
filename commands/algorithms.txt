BST -  l < n , r > n

sparse table - for immutable data  MRQ  between any two elements to form range
preprocess the results using dynamic programming  O(nlog(n)) for preprocessing
and O(1) for query

AVL is more balanced then RB tree but also caused more rotations during insertion

max heap and min heap tree - with duplicates allowed
