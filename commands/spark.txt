RDD vs dsm
lineage vs replicate strategy for fault tolerance
unifying batch, streaming, interactive
hadoop is oil tanker fast (talk about move  oil between continents)
its not OR its AND hadoop, complementary
data locality
primitives (create from stable storage)
transform (lazy operations), transformation not a materialization until later
Action return or write
stateful processing ,spark streaming 
-> batches of data(cached raw data) -> rdd by spark engine - > batches of processsed data
distributed gc
Ingestion models  - apache kafka , flume, storm

stage , narrow / wide dependency (group by, reduce by, involves shuffling of data)
spark is large scale compute cluster, not data cluster
hadoop is data parallel but processing sequential.
