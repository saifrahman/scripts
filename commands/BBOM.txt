BBOMBBOM - Big ball of mud
 why do we write code that slows down - answer is we wanted to go fast.
   slow is fast .
   cleans a  little bit , deliberately , carefully, calmly , surgeon he has got deadline.
   
   how does bad s/w slow u down
   good code should tell what it is doing, it is boring.
   rigidity ; something breaks in dependencies
      dependency is 
      fragility ; something breaks into somewhere that u can not predict.  like snow flakes
   
    desirable part of the code is horribly coupled with undesirable part - Non reusable / immobility
	
	most of the software work is about management dependencies
	
	inexorable forces and entropy-driven processes will inevitably reduce any system to a big ball of mud.
	
	Shanty Towns
Shanty Towns are easily built by unskilled labor with inexpensive materials, but the buildings are weak, function poorly, and require continuous maintenance. The same is true of much software ... where there is great pressure to get something out there as quickly as possible, and great resistance to investing up-front in design and infrastructure.
ThrowAway Code
Much software is written, knowing that it is not suitable for production use ... but once it exists time pressures create a powerful incentive to ship it as is rather than rewriting it. Again, the time and cost savings are immediate, while the expenses are in the future.
